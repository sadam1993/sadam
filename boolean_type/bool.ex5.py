Write the code to check the student pass the class or not. 
# To be able to pass the class student need to have at least 65 score from 
# the exams and student need to attend the at least 80 percent of all the classes. 
# To calculate the average score we need to take take 20 percent of first exam score 
# and 30 percent of second exam score and 50 percent of third exam score. 
# We are given variables for three exam scores and one variable 
# for attendance to classes. If all conditions are met, 


exam1 = 60
exam2 = 40
exam3 = 90
 
attendancy = 80 

averag_score = exam1*20/100 + 30/100 + exam3*50/100
 

is_attendancu_enough = attendancy >= 80
is_average_score_enough >= 65

can_pass = is attendancy_enough and is_average_score_enough
print("average score of the studentis", average score)
